1. Multiple and Hybrid Inheritance is not supported in Java, as it can cause unnecessary complexity (expecially in casting, constructor chaining and other java operations) and are rarely required.

2. Only Single-level, Multilevel, and Hierarchical Inheritance are supported in Java.

3. In Java a class can only have one super class, multiple sub classes.

4. If you need multiple super classes, use Multilevel Inheritance

5. For Inheritance we use 'extends' keyword. We use super() constructor in the constructor of the sub class to initialize the inherited attributes.

6. protected Access Modifier can be used when we want sub class to access the attribute in the super class directly.

7. Or we can use super.<attribute name in super class> to access the attribute in the super class.

8. polymorphism is the ability for an object or function to take many different forms.

9. Java supports runtime and compile time polymorphism.

10. polymorphism helps us reduce code complexity and write reuable code.
