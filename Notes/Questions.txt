Q. What is final??
The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override). The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...). The final keyword is called a "modifier".

Q. What is Race Condition??
A  race condition can be defined as, a condition in which two or more threads compete together to get certain shared resources.
For example, if thread A is reading data from the linked list and another thread B is trying to delete the same data. This process leads to a race condition that may result in run time error.

Q. What is Synchronization??
Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource. In the Multithreading concept, multiple threads try to access the shared resources at a time to produce inconsistent results. The synchronization is necessary for reliable communication between threads.

Q. What is mutual exclusion??
A mutex (or mutual exclusion) is the simplest type of synchronizer â€“ it ensures that only one thread can execute the critical section of a computer program at a time. To access a critical section, a thread acquires the mutex, then accesses the critical section, and finally releases the mutex.
